This project aims to develop a Streamlit web application that demonstrates and evaluates the capabilities of the Stability.ai API. The application will systematically test and showcase the following API functionalities and their corresponding models:

- Text to Image
- Image to Image
- Image to 3D
- Upscale
- Variation
- Inpainting

We will apply each feature step-by-step. Users will be able to select the feature they want to test and input the required parameters. The app will then generate the image(s) and display them.

General structure of the streamlit app will be as follows:
- At the sidebar, users will be able to select the feature they want to test.
- Users will be able to input the required parameters for the selected feature.
- The app will then generate the image(s) and display them.
